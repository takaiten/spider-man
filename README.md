## About
This is a pet project inspired by the "Spider-Man: No Way Home" [landing page concept by Minh Pham](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/minh-pham-9b67ba52_spider-man-movie-landing-page-concept-activity-6901805223615049728-K0Xz/?trk=public_profile_like_view&originalSubdomain=in).

The aim of this project is to create something similar to the concept using Next 13 as a frontend framework and Babylonjs for 3d graphics. I'm using react-babylonjs package for a more declarative approach.  

Created for educational and demonstrative purposes only.
